# fast-losless-image-compression-format

this is a WIP and can only be used in any way by me, unless i give explicit permission to make an exception to this rule.

this is a losless image format, similar to png.
Notable features are increased encoder/decoder speed compared to other alternatives like png and webp.
Compression level should be much better than png, getting close the compression of modern formats such as webp and jpeg xl.
